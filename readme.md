Welcome to 7 days of Algorithms!

I have been in the software development profession for around 3 years now and I guiltily admit, I have forgotten the basic algorithms, algorithms that I do not always need in a product development environment. So, I am starting this series called 7 days of Algorithm. I will eventually extend this to 30 days of Coding (mostly centered around Algorithms) and see if I can extend it to 100 days of Code.
If you too, like me feel that you need a brush up of algorithms, please feel free to join me in this journey. I have started from as basic as I could get.
Thanks!
